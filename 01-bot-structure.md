# Bot Structure

The clarkok bot is a multi-room bot, it structures its owned rooms as colonies. Each colony consists of an owned room together with its surrounding remote outposts. And all the colonies join their force and form a federal state.

Just like a few other bots, the clarkok bot uses state machines as its primary control mechanism. More specifically, the
bot uses a three-level state machine. From a top-down order, they are federal level, colony level and task level.

 * The federal level controls the highest level decision making, and coordinates all the colonies. It will give orders to the colony level, either via memory, or via a flag-based directive system to be mentioned below
 * The colony level controls whatever inside a colony, like managing resources, spawning creeps and assigning tasks to them
 * The task level controls a single creep or a squad in the lifetime of a single task

And each level can be broken down to multiple features, those features manage their own states. Some state machines arenot written out explicitly. For federal level and colony level features, each of them will have a method`TickFederalXXX` or `TickDirectiveXXX` which will be invoked for each tick, to check and modify their own states. Fortask level tasks, each of them will have a generator function whose `.next()` will be called each tick, to operate theircreeps or squads.

## The Command Chain, Directive System and Task System

The highest commands will be given by the human player or the federal level state machine. And most of time the commandwill be given in the following format: "HOW do WHICH colony do WHAT at WHEN", for example I need colony W3N8 attack aninvader core in room W4N5 using a single attacker now. The directive is given by placing a flag, whose primary color isred (attack), and secondary color is red (single attacker), in W4N5 (the target), and we set the flag name to`Flag1?owner=W3N8`, indicating the directive is given to W3N8. The flag can be placed either by a human manually, or by the federallevel automatically.

There are 2 major reasons to use flags here. 1) the flags is visible to both the bot, and the human player, so I can seethose existing directives when viewing the target room. 2) the human player can remove the flag if they want to stop adirective. For now we don't have a working android client, adding / removing flags is the primary approach that I use tocontrol my bot on my mobile phone. : )

Once a flag is put on the map, by either the player or the federal level state, it will be picked up by the colonylevel. The colony level feature for this directive will be triggered to parse the flag name / location and the meaning,then it will append a directive object to the colony's memory. If the flag name doesn't specify an owner, thecorresponding feature will find the most suitable colony and continue, otherwise remove the flag if no such colony canbe found.

Then for each tick, the directive executor will be called for each colony. It will check the current situation for thedirective, require corresponding creeps or squads from the colony, and assign tasks to them. And once the tasks isassigned, a generator-based thread will be spawned to operate the creep / squad to finished the task.

## Federal Level

The clarkok bot is more like a federal state than an empire, where colonies operate almost independently and theywill help each other only when needed or asked to. For now in the federal level, we have 5 features.

 * **Assigning outposts** - for calculating optimal outpost assignment for each owned room, base on the CPU, net gain forthe outpost, the spawn availability and etc.
 * **Balancing resources** - for balancing exceeding mineral / resources between colonies, and sell / buy resources ifpublic market is available
 * **Calculating room score** - for running room planner on every room with intel and save the result, so whenexpanding the bot will know which room is a good target
 * **Combat!**
 * Seasons related stuff

## Colony Level

There are 2 kinds of features in the colony level. One kind of features are called strategies, every colonies willexecute them, and the others are called directives, they will only be assign to colonies when needed. As for now the bothas 4 strategies, which are room development, mineral handling, intel and defense, and 21 directives, including offense,claim, deliver energy / resource to some location or help new colonies upgrade faster and etc.

## Task Level

As for now the bot has more than 40 tasks for individual creep, and a handful for squads. Some of the tasks are lifetimetasks, once assigned to a creep or a squad, it will keep operating units until they die out. And others have aterminate condition, once the task is done, the creep / squad will be set free and can be re-assigned to other tasks.
