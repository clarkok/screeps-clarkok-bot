## What's Screeps

[Screeps](https://screeps.com) is a MMORTS coding game in which you can write AI to operate units called creeps together with a few other structures. It's a sandbox game so everyone can do anything as long as it is not against ToS. To me, the goal is to create a competitive bot with high automation level, to survive and to conquer.

## But there is no code in this repo

The game itself doesn't prevent players from using open source bots developed by others, but overall it is a coding game. So most of fun comes from developing the bot yourself. I'm not going to put my bot open source for others to use it, but instead I'll introduce the structure and the design of it, to help beginners learn quickly, and to help myself sort my mind.

## Current status of the clarkok bot

The clarkok bot has gone through a handful of rewrites, the latest one started from Aug 23rd, 2020. In this rewrite, I switched to a generator-based implementation in typescript.

While the clarkok bot is not even close to one of the most advanced bots in the world, it's not that bad. As of writing, [the bot](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/clarkok) is currently at #24 in MMO expansion rank, and #70 in the power rank. It achieved #17 in the past season 1, #11 in season 2 and #8 in season 3.

Currently, the clarkok bot is fully automated in managing all the in-room stuff, and has the functionality to attack and expand, but the automated decision making for long range operations is not prefect yet.

It has 51k lines of code, 1.31MB after bundling, with a 1.22MB source map.
