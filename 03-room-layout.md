# Room Layout

----

![The Typical Room Layout](image/typical-layout.png)

As you can see in the above image, the clarkok bot is using a flexible room layout. In the layout procedure, the bot
will try every possible location for the spawn cluster, and for each attempt, place down the lab cluster, calculate the
roads to the sources / controller / mineral and the lab cluster, generate the extensions and towers in a dynamic manner,
and then use min-cut algorithm to place the ramparts. And from all those attempts, we choose the best solution to
minimize the usage of ramparts, and if multiple solutions use the same number of ramparts, we choose the one with
smallest number of roads from spawn cluster to sources and controllers. 

The planner is written in generators, and the execution is split to multiple ticks (often in hundreds or even thousands
of ticks), and except the first room, executed by the room score federal level state machine ahead of room claiming. So
it won't be a blocker. As for the first room, we use the fast mode in which we skip the rampart generation as it is the
most time-consuming part, to save us precious start up ticks.

## Spawn Cluster

![The Spawn Cluster](image/spawn-cluster.png)

The spawn cluster contains all 3 spawns and most of those singleton structures available in RCL8 rooms, together with 12
extensions, with a container in the center act as spawn cluster refill buffer. The spawn cluster is able to provide 1800
/ 3300 energy at RCL7 / RCL8. So together with those extensions around sources, we can spawn most of non-combat creeps
without the need to carrier refill other extensions.

In the diagonal surrounding locations of that container, there sit 4 standing creeps. The one near terminal / factory
and power spawn is the manager, and the rest 3 are fillers. The manager has the responsibility to balance resources
between the link / storage / terminal / factory and power spawn, and it will also fill the center container. And the
fillers will take energy from the center container and fill spawns and extensions in the cluster.

The spawn cluster is rotatable. It will rotate and make sure the distance between the storage and the controller is
minimize.

## Lab Cluster

The lab cluster contains all the 10 labs, a nuker and an observer. We put the nuker in the lab cluster instead of in the
spawn cluster, because the nuker needs only 3energy/tick transfer rate and a trivial one for `G`, which is much smaller
than the resource exchange rate between storage and terminal. The lab cluster is rotated to make sure the top left
corner in the image has shortest path to terminal.

Also, we ensure the two road wings in the lab cluster will not blocked by terrain walls or extensions / towers, with the
help of the accessibility system below, so when boosting the squads, the creeps can always go into the lab cluster from
the top left entrance, and leave the cluster from either of the wings. 

## Roads and the Accessibility System

The path finder used in the planner is a hand made one using A\* algorithm, it is slower comparing to the game provided
one, but it give us higher flexibility for example we can use float number as the cost, and we can use condition to
finish the path searching instead of using some destination points / ranges.

In the room planner's path finding, we prefer those points (called road points) at `(x + 52 - y) % 4 == A || (x + y) % 4
== B`, so the path can have higher probability following below pattern, where the constant `A` and `B` are chosen to
make sure the road before the storage is at the cross point. The reason we are doing this is, the roads placement is
done before extensions placement, so we need to leave proper space for the them in advance. 

```

rr      rr      rr
  rr  rr  rr  rr  rr
    rr      rr      
  rr  rr  rr  rr  rr
rr      rr      rr
  rr  rr  rr  rr  rr

```

We will calculate multiple paths in this stage, as listed below. The #1 part are done in a single path search targeting
multiple destinations, and the result is used to evaluate the score of the layout.

 1. path from storage to each source, and the controller
 2. path from terminal to mineral
 3. path from terminal to the lab cluster

Also, there can be some points of interests which needs to be accessible (we call them the access points), like the
decoders in the season #2. Also we don't want our extensions, either those near the sources or those placed dynamically,
block some narrow throttling points created by the terrain walls. So at this point the accessibility system comes in to
play.

### The Accessibility System

We maintain a access road map, starting from a clone of the terrain map with those roads generated by the above steps,
and the roads contains in both clusters. We will fill some other road points on that map, where future steps will avoid
place blocking structures on those road points, but those roads will not actually be built.

First step is for each access point, we find a path from the point to any of the exit points, and fill the path as road
in the access map, to ensure those access point can be accessible. 

Then, we assign a unique non-zero id to each group of unwalkable points, like terrain wall group, or the cluster of
structures we just placed. We prepare a new map (the id map) to record the group id of each point in the room, and
initially we only set the map for those unwalkable points, while other walkable points has zero in the map.

We add all the unwalkable points in a queue and start a flood fill all together. For each point the fill reached, it
will set the id map to the value of the previous point and add the new point back in the queue, if the new point has the
value zero in the map. Other wise if the current value of the new point is different from the previous point, we set it
a road in the *access* map, and throw it. We also throw the point if the access map has already been filled as a road at
that point.

In the end, we will get something like below, we will avoid putting unwalkable structures on those road points.

## Extensions and Towers

Now we got the access map, we can proceed with extensions and towers. First we will use the last point in the path to
each sources, as the standing miner's location. We will place a container there. And then we will check the surrounding
location to that point, if the location is free (not a road, not a terrain wall, and not marked as road in the access
map), we put a link first, and then extensions.

To place the rest of extensions and towers, we will do another flood fill from the road before the storage. For a point,
if it is a road point, unless all its surroundings has been visited, we put it as a road, otherwise we put it as an
extension or tower, based on the number of placed structures and the availability in each RCL. And other wise if the
point is not marked as road in the access map, we put a extension or tower.

## Ramparts

After all the structures are placed, we can finally set the ramparts up. The min-cut algorithm is straight forward, we
run it and it give us a set of points forming a cut from the base to the exits. We put ramparts on those points. But
that's not enough, as the ranged killers are sometimes strong enough to kill our defenders even before they got to the
ramparts. We need to build roads and extra protection for those defenders.

We will group the ramparts if they can access each other, and for each group, we will build a path with road to them,
and add roads under those ramparts. Then we do a flood fill again from exits, to identify the points where our enemy can
access. We will build a safe map base on it, a point is consider safe only if it is under a rampart, or it is at least 3
points far from those points where enemy can stand at. Finally we add ramparts for all the roads and structures if they
are not at safe. The safe map will be serialized and saved together with the plan result, and it will be used in room
defense when it comes alive.
